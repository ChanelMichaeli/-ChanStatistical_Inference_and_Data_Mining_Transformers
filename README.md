# Statistical_Inference_and_Data_Mining_Transformers
The project was done as part of a Kaggel competition described in the link below:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021

On this competition we will identify elements in student writing.
More specifically, we will automatically segment texts and classify argumentative and rhetorical elements in essays written by 6 th 12 th grade students.

In our case, we would like to locate and classify named entities in text (annotations) into predefined categories using Transformers.

See the python code in the final-feedback-prize-competition - Code jupyter notebook.
In addition, a presentation describing the project is attached in the final project -  presentation pdf file.
